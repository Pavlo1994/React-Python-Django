# Simple Auth0 FastAPI React Application

A simple application for user authentication & authiraztion (JWT based) and user management based on Auth0 service. Backend is in Python with FastAPI, integrated with auth0 client. Frontend is vanilla react application contains simple login, signup form, and google account login.
</br>
This repo is to be used for a quick start with Auth0 which can be a bit complex to begin with.

## Application Features
### Client-side
- Login (username and password)
- Signup (username and password)
- Google account login

### Server-side
#### Endpoints
- POST /token : exchange username and password with access token (JWT) from Auth0 service
- GET /me : exchange access token with user info
- POST /user : create user in Auth0 database connection
- DELETE /user/{user_id} : remove user from Auth0 database connection
* When using google account login for the first time a user entity will be created in Auth0 with corresponding user id. This user can be deleted (from Auth0) using the user_id and the DELETE /user endpoint. the social login occurs directly between the client side and the Auth0 service w/o going through the backend.

#### Authentication & Authorizations
- JWT verification
- Private endpoint example (must have access token to get access)
- Scoped-private endpoint example (must have access token and permissions to get access)

## Installation

Use the package manager [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to install python dependencies and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-install) to install client dependencies.

```bash
cd backend
poetry install
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### Set environment
#### Backend
```bash
cd backend
touch .env
```
Set the following variables in the `.env` file:
```bash
AUTH0_DOMAIN= 
AUTH0_ISSUER= 
AUTH0_API_DEFAULT_AUDIENCE= 
AUTH0_APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID= 
AUTH0_TEST_USERNAME=
AUTH0_TEST_PASSWORD=
AUTH0_MANAGEMENT_API_CLIENT_ID=
AUTH0_MANAGEMENT_API_CLIENT_SECRET=
AUTH0_MANAGEMENT_API_AUDIENCE=
```
Those values are from Auth0. You should have a tenant for the domain, an API and an Application.</br>
For passing all tests create a test user and add a 'read:test' permission to this test user.

#### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
touch .env
```
Set the following variables in the `.env` file:
```bash
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost"
REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN=
REACT_APP_AUTH0_API_DEFAULT_AUDIENCE=
```

## Testing
### Backend
```bash
./backend/scripts/test
```

### Frontend
TBA
